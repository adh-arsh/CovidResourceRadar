# Covid Resource Radar

Covid Resource Radar is an app which displays a persons need of covid related resource and availablity of the same on map.
If....lets say an oxygen cylinder, then can open the app and look for people who are providing the same.
and on the other hand, if somebody has ..lets say 10 oxygen cylinder, then can let everybody around them know that this person has 10 oxygen cylinders.

The app is designed in such way the a person who is in urgen need of a resource can have a big picture of the availabilty and can acquire it with least number of taps on screen.

To call someone from map : 3 taps!!!
To announce/request : 2 taps and some typing of details.

Throughout the app is design to not add onto the anxiety the user is already facing.

Which consists of an ocean of plugins, which reduced the time taken for development to just 2 days(for core functionalities) .. overall 6 days for complete development and testing.

Current Firebase is being used as the backend for the app.
